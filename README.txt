Hello! 
I accidentally wrote over my original Typescript file that I was supposed to submit after I had finished the lab.
I reached out to Professor Wehrwein about this issue and he told me I didn't need to re-do the lab as long as 
I included a Read Me file with an explanation of what happened.

I included the contents of what would have been contained in my typescript file that I got by copying and pasting directly from my command prompt. I added this as a typescript.txt file in my lab. I hope this can work as additional proof that I did complete the lab!


Again, I apologize!
