Hello! 
I accidentally wrote over my original Typescript file that I was supposed to submit after I had finished the lab.
I reached out to Professor Wehrwein about this issue and he told me I didn't need to re-do the lab as long as 
I included a Read Me file with an explanation of what happened.

I did copy and paste the contents of what my typescript file had recorded of the lab after I realized I had 
made a mistake, so I'd be more than happy to add a file containing the contents of my typescript file that I 
copied dirrectly from my command line editor if that is needed!

Again, I apologize!
