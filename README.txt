Hello! 
I accidentally wrote over my original Typescript file that I was supposed to submit after I had finished the lab.
I reached out to Professor Wehrwein about this issue and he told me I didn't need to re-do the lab as long as 
I included a Read Me file with an explanation of what happened.


Again, I apologize!
